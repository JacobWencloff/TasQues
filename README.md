#### Dev Search
---
Our DevSearch feature uses a RapidAPI powered by the google search engine in order to give our users search results pertaining specifically to software development. 

#### Todo List
---
Our Todo list is currently in the mid-life of its development, including 3 sub-sections in order to allow the user a more efficent manor to list tasks and break down goals.

#### Calculator 
---
The calculator component is the most crude portion of our site and definantly needs the most love, currently limiting the user to basic arithmatic.

## Future Features

Future renditions of our Dev Search feature will give the user the ability to add websites to the list of pre-existing sites allowing for user customization of the search engine. Along with the ability to include websites introduced by the user, we would also like to allow more than one website parameter to be used at a time in the search results.

Our ToDo list will have customizable headers along with the ability to create more headers than given to the user by default.

Lastley the calculator component will be completley restyled, including more functionality and more complex arithmatic including the ability to compute whole equations, along with having the ability to compute and convert non base 10 number systems.
